# Emotion-Detection-By-Using-KERAS-And-CNN
In this project, we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). We will use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once we have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, you will directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.  Once we have trained, saved we will directly run and detect our facial expression.
