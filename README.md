# Facial Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

Emotion detection has become a topic of continuous research and innovation as over the past decade the limitations of computer vision have been lifted by the introduction of machine learning. As machine learning algorithms leverage the huge computation power of GPU’s, the image processing capabilities of these models fit suitably with real world problems. Computer vision has spread from a novel domain to several other domains such as the behavioral sciences. These algorithms or models are being used in various real world applications across several fields such as security, driver-safety, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction and healthcare. These models are continuously evolving due to the introduction of graphical processing units which are hardware equipments capable of performing millions of computations within mere seconds or minutes. The emergence of technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality are also dependent on these GPU’s heavily. Hence, combining the statistical intelligence of machine learning algorithms and the processing power of GPU hardware, we are able to create breakthrough models capable of detecting emotions from static images as well as video feeds.
